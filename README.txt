For the lazy people who does'nt want to write commands,
A simple Batch Script to enable hotspot on windows 7-10, 
currently not being actively developed as Windows 10 >= Version 10.0.16299 Build 16299 
supports built in hotspot feature and provides internet sharing connection.

Sorry for the source code I lost it, while formatting my thumbdrive.

As for the record, Internet Sharing settings are to be done manually, via control pannel.
